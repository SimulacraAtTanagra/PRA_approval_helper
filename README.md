## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This project is for automating routine actions in PR-Assist, SOTA Systems proprietary appointment management software for Classified Employees at CUNY.
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
In order to mitigate the impacts of human error in execution and memory, I've written this project to take over a lot of my tasks. Anything that is repetitive, needs to happen in a scheduled fashion, or is oterhwise available to be taken off my plate, as it related to PR-Assist, is here or is a planned udpate.
This project leverages pandas, fuzzywuzzy, selenium, textract, webdriver_manager.


The expected frequency for running this code is Weekly.
